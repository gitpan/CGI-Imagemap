SYNOPSIS

  use CGI::Imagemap;
 
  $map = new CGI::Imagemap;

DESCRIPTION

CGI::Imagemap allows CGI programmers to emulate the NCSA C<imagemap>
CGI or place TYPE=IMAGE form fields on their forms.

The imagemap file follows that of the NCSA imagemap program.
See the NOTES section for further details.

I sought functionality like this because I was writing a map application
that would present the user with a multi-layered image. Each layer had
its own "hotspots" and so I needed to support a dynamic image map.
This module allowed me to pull in static layers of hotspots for all of
the layers shown in the image, or optionally define the hotpsots for
each layer dynamically as well.
